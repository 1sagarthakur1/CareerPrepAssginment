# 📚 Student Management Console App

## 📝 Overview
This is a simple Java console application developed to manage student records. It allows users to add students, update their marks, and view student details. The project is designed to strengthen object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java such as class creation, object instantiation, method usage, the `this` keyword, and basic object collaboration.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Practice using Java classes and objects
- Understand the use of constructors and methods
- Apply the `this` keyword effectively
- Demonstrate basic object collaboration
- Handle user input through the console

---

## 🧩 Features

### Core Features
- `Student` class with:
  - Fields: `name`, `rollNumber`, `course`, `marks`
  - Methods:
    - `displayDetails()`: Print student information
    - `updateMarks(int newMarks)`: Update marks for a student

- `Main` class:
  - Creates multiple `Student` objects
  - Stores them in an `ArrayList`
  - Demonstrates interaction between objects

- `this` keyword used:
  - Inside constructor
  - Within methods to resolve naming conflicts

### Stretch Goals (Implemented)
- `StudentManager` class:
  - `addStudent()`: Add a new student
  - `searchStudentByRollNo()`: Find student by roll number
  - `displayAllStudents()`: List all students
- Console-based input using `Scanner` for dynamic data entry
